This step-by-step tutorial walks you through setting up Sentry in both a frontend and backend sample application. After completing this tutorial you'll be able to trace the source and impact of your issues across projects and platforms. As part of this tutorial, you will:

- Configure the Sentry SDK on a sample React and Node/Express app.
- Trigger a sample front-error that in turn triggers a sample back-end error.
- Go into Sentry Distributed Tracing and see the details of your entire trace.

This tutorial uses a [sample React application](https://github.com/getsentry/frontend-tutorial) on the frontend as well as a sample [Node/Express API](https://github.com/getsentry/frontend-tutorial) as the backend. Some familiarity with JavaScript will help you follow along, you can also follow along with the provided sample code or apply the same steps to your own project.
