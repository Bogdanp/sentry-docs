description: "Learn about migrating from sentry-python 2.x to 3.x"
---

This guide describes the common patterns involved in migrating to version `3.x` of the `sentry-python` SDK. For the full list of changes, check out the [detailed migration guide in the repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Python Version Support

Sentry Python SDK `3.x` only supports Python 3.7 and higher. If you're on an older Python version, you'll need to stay on an older version of the SDK:

- Python 2.7-3.5: SDK `1.x`
- Python 3.6: SDK `2.x`

## API Changes

### Metrics

The `sentry_sdk.metrics` API doesn't exist anymore in SDK `3.x` as the [metrics beta has come to an end](https://sentry.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26369339769883-Metrics-Beta-Coming-to-an-End). The associated experimental options `enable_metrics`, `before_emit_metric` and `metric_code_locations` have been removed as well.
