If you are curious about how thread locality works for scope data, in .NET, there
are two modes for managing "ambient data". Usuaully Sentry will automatically choose the
most appropriate mode for your application type, however this can be overridden by
setting [`SentryOptions.IsGlobalModeEnabled`](../../configuration/options/#is-global-mode-enabled) manually.

If global mode is disabled (appropriate for most server-based applications), the
ambient scope data is stored as an `AsyncLocal` and so it will flow with the execution
context. Stephen Toub's blog post on [ExecutionContext vs SynchronizationContext](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext/)
explains that concept in more detail.

If global mode is enabled (appropriate for desktop applications), ambient scope data is
stored as a Singleton and available globally. This means you can set context (such as
the user logged into the application) once and it will be sent with all events, regardless
of whether the event was captured on the UI thread or a background thread.
